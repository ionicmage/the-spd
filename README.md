***NOTE: Repo empty until i finish the project. Est Summer 2025***

Welcome to the *Sh-tty Python Directory.*

***1: About the SPD***

This includes (almost) all of the code i wrote in my underclassman programming classes. (Besides the really *really* terrible codes)

It does not include the source code for the actual minigames, solely because theyre shit, and someone else could do a hundred times better lol. 

if you want to read the source code for any of the minigames, feel free to contact me.

I wrote this code for the directory in around three days, and i'm still adding to it. 

It will always be hosted and updated at PythonAnywhere as well. [Link]

The code is around 400 lines in all python (duh).

***2: Can i use the directory code?***

Yep, 100%. The repo is named "SPD" on my profile. Please read the readme.

--------------

Have fun using it, and have a lovely day.

(P:S. if enough people are interested, ill release the full source code in this repo.)
