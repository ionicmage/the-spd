***NOTE: Repo empty until i finish the project. Est Summer 2025***

This is the *Sh-tty Python Directory.*

a collection of minigames written in Python that i built in my underclassman programming classes.

This repo will include only the skeleton code for the directory function. 

The actual functioning code including the minigames is going to be hosted **somewhere else**.

**It does not include the code i wrote in my underclassman programming classes, or the source code for the actual minigames, solely because theyre shit, and someone else could do a hundred times better lol.**
if you want to read the source code for any of the minigames, feel free to contact me.

I wrote this code for the directory in around a week, and i'm still adding to it.

Have fun using it, and have a lovely day.
