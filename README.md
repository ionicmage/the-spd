***NOTE: Repo empty until i finish the project. Est Summer 2025***

Welcome to the *Sh-tty Python Directory.*

***1: About the SPD***

This repo includes the skeleton code for the directory function. 

The actual functioning code including the minigames is going to be hosted somewhere else.

**NOTE: It does not include the code i wrote in my underclassman programming classes, or the source code for the actual minigames, solely because theyre shit, and someone else could do a hundred times better lol.**
  if you want to read the source code for any of the minigames, feel free to contact me.

----

I wrote this code for the directory in around three days, and i'm still adding to it. 

The code is around 400 lines in all python (duh).

----

Have fun using it, and have a lovely day.
