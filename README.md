Welcome to the *Sh-tty Python Directory.*

This is the about me for the SPD, which includes (almost) all of the code i wrote in my underclassman programming classes. (Besides the really *really* terrible codes)

I'm not including the source code for the stuff solely because its shit, and someone else could do a hundred times better lol. if you want to read the source code for any of the minigames, feel free to contact me.

Quite honestly, i just needed a place to host.

I wrote this code for the directory in around three days, and i'm still adding to it. 

It will always be hosted and updated at PythonAnywhere as well. [Link]

The code is around 400 lines in all python (duh).

Have fun using it, and have a lovely day.

(P:S. if enough people are interested, ill release the full source code in this repo.)
