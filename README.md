***NOTE: Repo empty until i finish the project. Est Summer 2025***

This is the *Sh-tty Python Directory.*

a collection of minigames written in Python that i built in my underclassman programming classes.

<strike>This repo will include only the skeleton code for the directory function. 

The actual functioning code including the minigames is going to be hosted somewhere else.

It does not include the code i wrote in my underclassman programming classes, or the source code for the actual minigames, solely because theyre shit, and someone else could do a hundred times better lol. if you want to read the source code for any of the minigames, feel free to contact me.</strike>

**UPDATE**

i changed my mind, the repo is pretty basic python so im not too attached to it. ill find somewhere to host it and let you all have at it.

```dir.py``` is the file including games

```index.py``` is the file with only the directory function

----

I wrote this code for the directory in around a week, and i'm still adding to it.

Have fun using it, and have a lovely day.
